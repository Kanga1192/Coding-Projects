1. Receive input from user to open chosen dataset file.
2. Count the number of rows in the chosen dataset file.
3. Count the number of columns in the chosen dataset file.
4. Calculate the most bought type of aircraft across the airlines.
5. Calculate the average age of the aircraft across the airlines.
6. Calculate the lowest number of aircraft bought across the airlines.
7. Calculate the highest number of aircraft bought across the airlines.
8. Receive input from user to output chosen values from the calculations in task 2 â€“ 7 to the console.
